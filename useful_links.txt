Stuff that looks useful.

The website for crowdsourced classification projects. They claim that lots of trained users are better than
"even the smartest computers" -- can we put that statement to the test?

Their data page:

Hubble Data Archive -- might be useful for obtaining training data.
We could try to use the NGC or IC objects photographed by Hubble to train a galaxy classifier.

Planet Hunters uses Kepler lightcurve data to find exoplanets! This is pretty cool.
It's crowdsourced in the same spirit as Galaxy Zoo.

Data seems to be stored in FITS files. In order to handle these, here are some options:
	PyFITS, for Python, by STSci (being phased out)
	http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyfits
	http://www.astropython.org/tutorial/2010/10/PyFITS-FITS-files-in-Python

	AstroPy, for Python
	http://www.astropy.org/
	http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/index.html

	PFITS, for Python (calls FITSIO, below)
	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pfits

	FITSIO, for C and Fortran (!)
	http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/

	CCFits, for C++ (calls FITSIO)
	http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/ccfits/

	JFits, for Java
	http://www.eso.org/~pgrosbol/fits_java/jfits.html

The Kepler light curves contain time series data.
http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/archive_manual.pdf
The data attributes include:
	-TIME - Time
	-TIMECORR - Time correction
	-SAP_FLUX - Flux in electrons/second
	-SAP_FLUX_ERR - error in flux
	-SAP_BKG - background 
	-SAP_BKG_ERR - error in background
	etc....

Things I haven't found yet, though they're probably not too hard to find:
 - Lightcurves of negative examples, such as ordinary stars.
 - Lightcurves of variable stars without exoplanets (which will probably be among the greatest sources of error)
 - Lightcurves of eclipsing binaries (which produce very similar-looking curves, and should be trained against)
 - For the galaxy project, I'm not sure how exactly we would put together the training data. To wit, I don't know
   where to find a big list of the form "SDSS 200301 is Elliptical, 200302 is Barred Spiral, ..."
