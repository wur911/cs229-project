In this project we aim to use supervised learning to develop a classifier for stellar lightcurves
 to detect whether they demonstrate the existence of exosolar planets.

\section{Introduction}
% What are exoplanets? How are they detected?
The recent discoveries of planets around stars other than our own is among the most significant trends in astronomy today. Long debated by philosophers and physicists alike, no such planets were known until 1992, when two planets were discovered around a star called PSR B1257+12. In the two decades since then, over a thousand such planets have been discovered, diverse in many ways. Thanks to these discoveries, astronomers are learning more about planetary systems other than our own, responding to these questions about other solar systems and even how probable Earth-like life could be in the universe.

In this paper, we will use the following standard terminology.
\begin{itemize}
	\item An \emph{exosolar planet} is defined to be a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun.\footnote{The words \emph{exoplanet}, \emph{exosolar planet}, and \emph{extrasolar planet} all mean the same thing, and are used interchangeably.} The standard definition of a planet has two kinds of ambiguity: very low-mass objects in our solar system, such as Pluto, were defined to be ``dwarf planets,'' and the boundaries of this definition aren't entirely clear. Very high-mass planets, however, resemble very small stars; though they don't undergo hydrogen fusion, they look very much like a dim type of star called a brown dwarf. The boundary is somewhat arbitrarily delineated at 14 Jupiter masses. However, neither of these is a great concern in this paper: science is yet unable to detect Pluto-sized worlds around another star, so the low-mass ambiguity does not arise in this data, and the high-mass boundary is not as important: a classifier that discovers planets and small brown dwarfs is still useful. However, it will be helpful to distinguish these systems from eclipsing binaries (see below).
	\item \emph{Planetary transit} is a method of exoplanet detection, In general, because planets are very dim relative to their bright host stars, they cannot be directly imaged, in the same way that it is difficult to detect a firefly near a searchlight from afar. Thus, several indirect methods exist. Planetary transit repeatedly checks the brightness of a star over time; periodic, regular dips in this output sometimes happen because an exoplanet crosses between its sun and the observer. Thus, a planet may be detected without direct observation.
	\item A \emph{lightcurve} is a graph of a star's brightness over time. A transiting exoplanet will thus manifest itself as a lightcurve that is relatively constant, but with regular, small dips.
	\item An \emph{eclipsing binary}
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
We obtained Kepler light curves from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes. We first divided light curves into those corresponding to exoplanets and those corresponding to non-exoplanets. The light curves are represented as time series data, which means that each light curve is represented by a series of attributes at each time point within some range. The attributes of the light curve stored in the binary table and are data attributes that we are going to be looking at include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item TIME
	\item SAP\_Flux 
	\item SAP\_Flux\_Err
	\item SAP\_BKG
	\item SAP\_BKG\_Err
	\item PDCSAP\_Flux
	\item PDCSAP\_Flux\_Err
	\item PSF\_Centr1
	\item PSF\_Centr1\_Err
	\item PSF\_Centr2
	\item PSF\_Centr2\_Err
	\item MOM\_Centr1
	\item MOM\_Centr1\_Err
	\item MOM\_Centr2
	\item MOM\_Centr2\_Err
	\item POS\_CORR1
	\item POS\_CORR2
\end{itemize}
